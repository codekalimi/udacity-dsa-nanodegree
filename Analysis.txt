# Task0.py
  The time complexity of this function is O(1) because the function only prints the first and last record of the texts and calls list.
  The time complexity is constant.

# Task1.py
    The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of records in the telephone_numbers list.

# Task2.py
    The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of calls in the calls list.

# Task3.py
    The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of calls in the calls list.
    The function iterates through the calls list to determine the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people in Bangalore.
    The function also determines the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore that are made to fixed lines also in Bangalore.
    The time complexity is linear.

# Task4.py
    The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of calls and texts in the calls and texts list.
    The function iterates through the calls list twice and the texts list once.
